An incredibly creative idea where queer people could drop down pins anywhere in the world, with a story accompaning each one. This helped me realize how many people like me are living in my surrounding area, and the stories range from heartbreaking love letters to one-liners. If you ever need to hear some stories from other LGBTQ+ individuals, this is a beautiful place to do so.
