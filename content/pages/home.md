This is not a detailed guide to trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming folks. You can find a list of other great resources [here](temp).

This is, however, where you should begin your journey: whether that shall be one of self discovery, of learning to put down hate, or simply one of curiosity. This space is meant to be **100% neutral**, with its ultimate goal being to **educate**. No matter your political leaning, you should be able to enjoy this wiki, as most information is sourced from reputable articles and research papers.

If you're ready to move on, the sidebar is where all the content is. If you would like to learn, start at [Gender Identity](/gender-identity) and work your way down for a brief introduction. There are a lot of detailed, greatly organized information in [Further Reading](/resources/reading), and before you comment, make sure to check out [Common Arguments](/resources/arguments)


Welcome, and I hope you will enjoy your stay!
