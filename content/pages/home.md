This is not a detailed guide to trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming folks. You can find a list of other great resources [here](temp).

This is, however, where you should begin your journey: whether that shall be one of self discovery, of learning to put down hate, or simply one of curiosity. This space is meant to be **100% neutral**, with its ultimate goal being to **educate**. No matter your political leaning, you should be able to enjoy this wiki, as most information is sourced from reputable articles and research papers.

::: callout 
Keep in mind that any page with an asterisk (\*) means it is influenced by *personal emotions and experiences*, and are subjective in nature. Still, **they are incredibly helpful pieces nontheless, and I highly recommend checking them out.**

If you're ready to move on, the sidebar is where all the content is. Follow the pages by order, or simply find what you need. If you'd like to know more about this website, its purpose, the story of its creator, and his motivations, check out the [Personal](/personal) page and all the subpages following it. And read [Dedications](/dedications), for those I could not thank enough.

Welcome, and I hope you will enjoy your stay!
