One's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One's gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth.[^1]

To understand those who are transgender, nonbinary, and such, one must first understand the definition of gender identity. Gender identity is often defined as your **internal knowledge of your gender** – knowledge that you're feminine, masculine, or neither. 

A **cisgendered** person is defined as someone whose gender corresponds with their sex they had at birth.[^2] On the other hand, a **transgendered** person is defined as someone whose gender identity differs from the one they have had at birth.[^3] For example, a trans man is often born **AFAB** (Assigned Female At Birth), and is often refered to as **FTM** (Female-To-Male). Similarily, a trans woman is often born **AMAB** (Assigned Male At Birth) and thus is referred to as **MTF** (Male-To-Female).

There are a lot more nuances out there. For example, **non-binary** individuals has a gender identity that neither corresponds with the male nor female gender, and thus expresses themselves as such.[^4] A non-binary individual could be more feminine, more masculine, or in between, depending on their gender identity. 

In the end, one's gender identity is largely thought to be from biological factors, and not something that could be altered in the spur of the moment.[^5] Similarily, it is incredibly difficult to transition one's gender.

**Gender transitioning** involves both medical and social aspects, and is defined as the process of changing one's gender presentation or sex characterics to better fit in with oneself's gender identity.[^6] **Socially transtioning** involves simply changing how one presents themselves to the general public, while **medically transitioning** involves a complicated, arduous, scientifically proven process that alters one's biological makeup. It is argued that one could be trans without actually medically transitioning.[^7]

Often, transitioning is not a choice, but instead the only way to preserve one's well being. See [gender dysphoria](/gender-identity/dysphoria/).

> The system works because it is based on objective evidence, crucially a clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and those medical reports. A medical practitioner testifies that changing legal sex is necessary to promote mental wellbeing.[^8]
